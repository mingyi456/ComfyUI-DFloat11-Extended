This repository provides the **ComfyUI plugin for DFloat11 models**.

DFloat11 reduces model size by more than **30%** while producing **bit-for-bit identical outputs** to the original. Unlike quantization techniques which trade quality for size, DFloat11 is a **lossless compression method**, preserving model output quality fully while supporting efficient inference.

Currently, only **FLUX.1 models** are supported. Support for additional models is planned. Please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/LeanModels/ComfyUI-DFloat11/issues) and let us know which ones you'd like to see next.

## Features

* ðŸš€ **Fully Lossless** â€“ 100% identical outputs to the original model
* ðŸ“¦ **>30% smaller model size** â€“ lower VRAM requirements than the original model
* âš¡ **Compatible with ComfyUI** â€“ drop-in support with custom nodes
* ðŸ”§ **GPU-accelerated inference** â€“ optimized for CUDA 12.1+

---

## Installation

### Requirements

* [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) installed
* NVIDIA GPU with **CUDA 12.1+**

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Install the DFloat11 custom nodes in ComfyUI:

   ```bash
   cd <ComfyUI_installation_path>/custom_nodes
   git clone https://github.com/LeanModels/ComfyUI-DFloat11.git
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Once installed, the DFloat11 nodes show up under the `DFloat11` folder in the *Node Library*.
2. Download a DFloat11 model for ComfyUI from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/DFloat11) and place it under `<ComfyUI_installation_path>/models/diffusion_models`.
3. Drag and drop a `*.png` or `*.json` file from [workflows](https://github.com/LeanModels/ComfyUI-DFloat11/tree/master/workflows) into ComfyUI to load the workflow.
4. (Optional) Use the `DFloat11 Model Loader` node to load the model in `*.safetensors` format, which acts as a drop-in replacement for the `Load Diffusion Model` node.
